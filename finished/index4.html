		<br>

<b>1.</b> To assemble pizzas, place 2-oz. of the sauce in the center of each pizza and use a circular motion to spread it to about 3/4-in. from the edge.
<br>
<b>2.</b> Distribute sliced garlic and scatter with oregano.
<br>
<b>3.</b> Drizzle each pie with about 1 Tbsp. of olive oil.
<br>
<b>4. </b> Transfer the pizza into the oven. Once the crust begins to brown, and the top and bottom of the pizza are evenly colored (30 seconds to 1 minute), remove the pizza from the oven.
<br>
<b>5.</b>Transfer the pizza to a cooling screen for about 1 minute to prevent steaming and then move it to a cutting board to slice.<br><br>

	<p class="subt">Marinara Pizza</p>
	
	<div>
	
	<p class="bodcopy">Pizza Margherita is a typical Neapolitan pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, salt and extra-virgin olive oil. <br><br>
	
	It has been stated the pizza marinara was introduced around the year 1735, and was prepared using olive oil, cherry tomatoes, basil, oregano and garlic at that time. Historically, it was known to be ordered commonly by poor sailors, and made on their ships due to it being made from easily preservable ingredients.
