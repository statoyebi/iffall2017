	1. Remain consistent with either solid background or gradient
	<br>
	2. Think about text alignment
	<br>
	3. Last image is pixelated
	<br>
	4. Think about variety of compositions
	<br>
	5. Consider using the dierection of the image to inform the typ treatment, such as the middle images, because he is centered, I think it was a good choice to include type on both sides as well as the mobile version of the first image, because he is looking to the right, the placement of the text on the right allows them to interact in a way.
	<br>
	6. Think about the tone of the images and the color of the background.
